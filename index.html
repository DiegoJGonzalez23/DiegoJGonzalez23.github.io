<p>           Hi and welcome to my website. This was made so I can link my youtube tutorials,
     my resume, and my personal projects that I want to make in the future. Hopefully this can serve as one stop shop for everything I have made.
</p>

<p>           A little about me: I am currently a high school junior and attend Doral Academy High. I compete in both Math and computer science competitions for school and in 
    my free time I like to play basketball with friends.
